## Architecture

### Three-Tier Design

**Background Script** (`background.js`)
- Monitors all network requests via WebRequest API
- Detects streaming URLs using pattern matching
- Manages session storage per tab
- Coordinates message passing between components
- Handles all backend processing

**Backend Modules** (Phase 2)

- `download-manager.js` - Multi-stream download queue
- `batch-controller.js` - Batch operation coordinator
- `metadata-extractor.js` - Content metadata extraction
- `analytics-engine.js` - Statistics and insights
- `quality-analyzer.js` - Stream quality analysis

**UI Layer** (Popup)
- `popup.html` - 7-tab interface structure
- `popup.css` - Theming, animations, responsive design
- `popup.js` - UI logic, event handling, backend integration

**Storage Layer**
- `storage-manager.js` - Persistent data management
- Browser Storage API for history, favorites, settings
