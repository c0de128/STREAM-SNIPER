  STREAM SNIPER - FINAL STEPS TO COMPLETE SETUP
================================================================================

CURRENT STATUS:
  âœ“ Firefox is running
  âœ“ Extension built and ready
  âœ“ yt-dlp installed
  âœ“ FFmpeg installed
  âœ“ Native messaging configured
  âš  Extension ID needs to be added to manifest

================================================================================
  FOLLOW THESE 5 SIMPLE STEPS:
================================================================================

STEP 1: Load Extension in Firefox
----------------------------------
  a. Firefox should already be open to: about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox
     (If not, type that in the address bar)

  b. Click the button: "Load Temporary Add-on..."

  c. A file picker will open. Navigate to:
     C:\Users\KevinMcKay\Downloads\M3U8\builds

  d. Select the file: stream-sniper-firefox-v2.0.zip

  e. Click "Open"

  âœ“ Extension loads! You'll see "Stream Sniper" in the list


STEP 2: Copy Extension ID
--------------------------
  On the about:debugging page, you'll see "Stream Sniper" listed.

  Look for one of these:
    - "Internal UUID"
    - "Extension ID"
    - Or an ID that looks like: {12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012}

  COPY THIS ENTIRE ID (including the curly braces { })

  Example: {a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890}


STEP 3: Update Manifest File
-----------------------------
  a. Open Notepad (or any text editor)

  b. Open this file:
     C:\Users\KevinMcKay\AppData\Roaming\StreamSniper\com.streamsniper.ytdlp.json

  c. You'll see: "{EXTENSION_ID_PLACEHOLDER}"

  d. Replace {EXTENSION_ID_PLACEHOLDER} with YOUR Extension ID from Step 2
     (Keep the quotes around it!)

  e. Save the file


STEP 4: Restart Firefox
------------------------
  Close Firefox completely and restart it.


STEP 5: Reload Extension
-------------------------
  a. Go back to: about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox

  b. Click "Load Temporary Add-on..." again

  c. Select: stream-sniper-firefox-v2.0.zip

  âœ“ Extension is now fully loaded with yt-dlp support!


================================================================================
  TEST IT WORKS:
================================================================================

Test 1: Basic Functionality
----------------------------
  1. Visit YouTube.com or Twitch.tv
  2. Click the Stream Sniper icon in your toolbar
  3. You should see detected streams appear!
  4. Try clicking a stream to preview it


Test 2: yt-dlp Integration
